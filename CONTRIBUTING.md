# **Croffle-CSS Contribution Guide**
Below is a brief outline of various ways to contribute to the Croffle-CSS framework! Please carefully follow the steps to avoid confusion and mishaps. 

## Fork the GitHub Repository 
Link to the repository: https://github.com/saemirii/croffle-css

## Make a CodePen to add module styles!
As an efficient way to see how you style your buttons, modals, etc submissions, I will require everyone to make a simple CodePen to showcase your design. After I approve it, you may proceed to making the pull request on GitHub. 

Below is a good example of what the CodePen should contain: https://codepen.io/carlosrrdev/pen/qBGpLYp?editors=1100

**IMPORTANT**: If your contribution is to just fix minor errors such as bugs and not style submissions, you don't need to submit any CodePen.

## Making the Pull Request
For organization, kindly put the description of your pull request in this format:
```
**Type of element**: button/modal/font/etc
**Name of element**: <name>-<element> (ex. shadow-btn, popup-modal)
**Style description**: 
**CodePen Link**:
```

**FOR FONTS**: Rename your file as the actual name of the font.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that you make a separate file for each style and rename it as its style name! Put it under its appropriate folder (button, modal, utils, fonts, etc.). This will make it easier to navigate.
